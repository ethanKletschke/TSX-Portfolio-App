# Notes About Contributing

Because this is a personal portfolio project, I'm not accepting external
contributors for this repo. Pull Requests have also been disabled (to the best of
my abilities).

Thank you for your understanding!  
Please see [the support document](./SUPPORT.md) if you have a problem or issue
with the app, or if you need to contact me! :smile:
