## Pages

### Consecutive Summation

On this page, you can input a number to add to a previous number (starting at 0)
with each button press, and you can optionally add a "step" (how many times
to add the same number).

### Custom Email Validator

On this page, you can validate an entered email address, and the app will automatically
validate the email as you type it using a custom RegExp instead of the built-in browser
validator.

### Sentence Sorting

On this page, you can enter a sentence, and the program will sort it by its individual letters.

### South African ID Number Validator

On this page, you can enter a South African ID number (13 digits), and
validate it, including the 13th checksum digit.
